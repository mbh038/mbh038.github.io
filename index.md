## Currently

I have worked as a lecturer in the HE in FE sector for 19 years, having previously been a research physicist in Switzerland and France for 6 years. I have written, managed and delivered a number of HE courses up to Masters level, including a BSc Renewable Energy and Carbon Management. In the last two years, in an effort to develop my data modelling and analysis skills,  I have successfully completed many (>25) MOOCs in statistical analysis, machine learning, big data and more, mainly using R, and Python but also Matlab, MS Azure and other tools. I have so far used these new skills to carry out market research, to model heat flows in old buildings, to simulate wind speed and solar variation and to model a pumped storage energy solution for a local town.  The heat flow work was part of a long running collaboration with conservation officers within Cornwall Council, funded by a Townscape Heritage Initiative lottery money. It was published last year and presented at an international conference (EECHB 2016). I am now embarking on a machine learning/IoT project to develop a biologger and software to determine the state of movement of farm animals from accelerometer data alone.

## Publications

I have 24 publications in peer reviewed journals, almost all dating from my years as a post-grad and post-doc 1989-1998. See my profiles on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Hunt3) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=CzkAKxMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F5qsrBMkWZIAPb3GNpMTwxYMYZ9GItK2ADl3b7F_q59sYpGJfrmvCB5EVf3lx3pYzmzzfo9jIOc1cQ2u0X57oVi4vMyBw) for listings of these. One paper was published in Nature and has over 300 citations. More recently (2016) I presented work at an international conference [](EECHB, 2016)](http://www.eechb.eu) on energy efficiency in historic buildings.  This was an analysis carried out using R of heat flow through thick, solid walls.

## Certifications  

Many online courses in 2015-2016.  The code written for most of these can be found in repos on my GitHub page. Most courses required between 20 and 100 hours of work over 4 - 8 weeks.
